/* 
factorial
Write a function, factorial, that takes in a number n and returns the factorial of that number. 
The factorial of n is the product of all the positive numbers less than or equal to n. 
You must solve this recursively.

For example, the factorial of 6 is:

6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720

@test-cases:
------------
factorial(3); // -> 6
factorial(6); // -> 720
factorial(18); // -> 6402373705728000
factorial(1); // -> 1
factorial(0); // -> 1
