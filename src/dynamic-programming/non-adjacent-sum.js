/* 
non adjacent sum
----------------
Write a function, nonAdjacentSum, that takes in an array of numbers as an argument. 
The function should return the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in the array. 
There is no limit on how many elements can be taken into the sum as long as they are not adjacent.

For example, given:
[2, 4, 5, 12, 7]

The maximum non-adjacent sum is 16, because 4 + 12. 
4 and 12 are not adjacent in the array.

@example:
const nums = [2, 4, 5, 12, 7];
nonAdjacentSum(nums); // -> 16
