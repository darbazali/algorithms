/* 
max palin subsequence
---------------------
Write a function, maxPalinSubsequence, that takes in a string as an argument. 
The function should return the length of the longest subsequence of the string that is also a palindrome.

A subsequence of a string can be created by deleting any characters of the string, while maintaining the relative order of characters.

@test-case:
----------
maxPalinSubsequence("luwxult"); // -> 5
