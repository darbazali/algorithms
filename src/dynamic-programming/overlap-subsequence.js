/* 
overlap subsequence
-------------------
Write a function, overlapSubsequence, that takes in two strings as arguments. 
The function should return the length of the longest overlapping subsequence.
A subsequence of a string can be created by deleting any characters of the string, 
while maintaining the relative order of characters.

@test-cases:
-----------
overlapSubsequence("dogs", "daogt"); // -> 3
