/* 
shortest path
-------------
Write a function, shortestPath, that takes in an array of edges for an undirected graph and two nodes (nodeA, nodeB). 
The function should return the length of the shortest path between A and B. 
Consider the length as the number of edges in the path, not the number of nodes. 
If there is no path between A and B, then return -1. 
You can assume that A and B exist as nodes in the graph.

@example:
---------
const edges = [
  ['w', 'x'],
  ['x', 'y'],
  ['z', 'y'],
  ['z', 'v'],
  ['w', 'v']
];

shortestPath(edges, 'w', 'z'); // -> 2
